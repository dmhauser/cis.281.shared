# cis.281.shared
This is where students in CIS.281 can share their works-in-progress

Every project should be uploaded as a .zip file

Every project file should be saved with your name, the project name, and the version number, e.g. Hauser-UtterNonsense-v1.1b

Note: the version number should change for each version of your file:
     A change from v1.0 to v2.0 indicates a major update
     A change from v1.1 to v1.2 indicates a smaller update
     A change from v1.1a to v1.1b might indicate that you're testing out a minor update

I will not hold you to a specific numbering/versioning method, but I do want you to be consistent in your numbering.

When you post in the forum to let us know that you've updated to the repository and want feedback, be sure to include the version number!
